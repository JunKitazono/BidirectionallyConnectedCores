This folder contains the codes for reproducing the simulations in Kitazono et al., 2020.

HierarchicalStructure.m
Find complexes of a simple exemplary model (Fig 7).

ComputationTime.m
Measure the computation time of searching for complexes by simulations (Fig 8).

ECoGDataAnalysis.m
Apply Hierarchical partitioning for complex search (HPC) to ECoG data (Fig 9).

See each m-file for more details.
