This toolbox provides MATLAB codes for end-to-end computation for practical versions of integrated information theory. This toolbox is an update of our previous version of the toolbox available at figshare (doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.3203326). In this new version, the algorithms for searching for complexes are newly implemented. The features available in this toolbox are summarized in the table below.
